1.Why do u need to find Time Complexity?
2.Which 
3.What is Big O Notation?
4.How online course works? and to de

Description,
Time taken by an Algorithm 
as the function of 
length of input.

--To find which algorithm is better
--Ex,
Q>find sum from 1-N?
Step1: using formula
Step2: using loop

Q>find key in a linear array? 
Step1:


Q>Worst case vs Best case??
at most time it should take(Big O) i.e.
Rules: 1.the upper bound and 2. ignore constants.

Theta/Omega Notation??

Find Big O of Recursive function?
