Its is a protocol.

Kerbros

SAML:Security Assertion Markup Language (SAML) 
	It is a login standard that helps users access applications based on sessions in another context. 
	Itâ€™s a single sign-on (SSO) login method offering more secure authentication (with a better user experience) 
	than usernames and passwords.
OAuth


Active Directory(Identity provider is Azure AD)
Dropbox will be the (service provider).
->maintaining credentials for multiple accounts is difficult. u cant login to facebook with gmail credentials.
so there are some Identity provider's:FB,Google,Apple etc.. 
->For admins also its difficult to manage all credentials. what if a user resigns u can not go to individuals apps to disable his creds.so we need SSO.

Different Protocols:

How do we achieve SSO? using Password Hash Synchronization.

Azure AD vs OnPremise AD??

Why we need SAML??

Azure AD connect vs SAML?

What is SAML?
==>Identity provider will store the credentials.
==>For Ex AD uses NTLM/Kerbros to authenticate Apps
==>Currently we are using SAML/Oauth/OpenID

Terminology used??
1.Idp(Identity provider)=Azure AD 
2.Service Provider=Dropbox

Steps for SAML configuration?
1.Trust relation betn IdP and SP(using Metada XML--undersatnd config info and baseline Trust)

Flow,
1.user tries to access the applications
2.application finds the AD is Azure 
3.application generates a saml 2.0 auth req xml and redirects user to AD login page
4.Now Azure logs in the user and creates a token then send this Token back to Application.
5.Application verifies the Token and user-sign in is complete.

SAML vs OAuth??
->SAML 2.0 is designed to authenticate a user, so providing user identity data to a service. 
->OAuth 2.0 is designed as an authorization protocol permitting a user to share access to specific resources with a service provider.
